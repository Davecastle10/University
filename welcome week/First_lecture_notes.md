## Java

Will be using JDK 17, but it is installed on the virtual lab, so don't really need to worry too much about that.  

- Java compiles to byte code that is run on the Java Virtual Machine, this means that Jvae code can be run on any device with a java virtual machine without needing to be re compiled, this adds more security as the Java Virual Machine (JVM) seperates the code from the device so it can pick up on damgerous code/security risks

- The compiler and code only does exactly what you tell it to do, so it mi9ght still run, but the output is wrong because you made an error.

- You can use // to comment in Java code, this means what us written in the comment is ignored by the compiler, so yiou can use the comment to explain what you are doing. and you can use /* and */ to create multi line comments

- be explicit/descriptive with variable names, because it can make it easier to read/understand and reduce the need for lots of comments
